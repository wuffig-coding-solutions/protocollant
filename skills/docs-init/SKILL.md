name: docs-init
description: Scaffold the docs/ knowledge base for this project. Analyzes the codebase and creates initial versions of all managed doc files. Run this once when setting up the protocollant plugin on an existing project.
---

You are performing a one-time knowledge base initialization for this project.

## Steps

1. Check if `docs/` exists. Create it if not.

2. Run a brief codebase scan to gather initial facts:
   - Read `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` / `Cargo.toml` (whatever exists) for deps and scripts
   - Scan the top-level directory structure (2 levels deep)
   - Check for existing README, existing docs, or any architecture diagrams
   - Check for `.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile` for infra context

3. For each of the following files, create it in `docs/` if it doesn't exist yet.
   Use the initial content format below. If a file already exists, skip it.

4. Fill in whatever you can determine from the codebase scan into the relevant files. For `architecture.md`, try to populate the Module Map and Key Layers based on the directory structure. For `dependencies.md`, list the key runtime dependencies from the package manifest with a brief note on what each is for.

5. Run @doc-updater to patch `CLAUDE.md` with the full routing table.

6. Report: list which files were created vs already existed.
